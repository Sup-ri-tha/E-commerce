 # Milestone-11 & 12
- Connected the product form frontend to MongoDB.  
- Updated `products.js` to use the GET router for fetching data from MongoDB.  
- Passed retrieved data to `home.jsx` to display existing products.  
- Planned to implement Nodemailer in Milestone 12 but skipped it based on mentor's advice.  
- Modified the POST router to make the form functional, enabling new product uploads to the database.
