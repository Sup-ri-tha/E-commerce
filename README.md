# Milestone-15

- Created a responsive navbar using **Tailwind CSS** with a `flex` layout for alignment.  

- Added navigation links to **Home, Product Form, Login, and Signup** for easy access.  

- Used `NavLink` from React Router to enable smooth navigation and highlight the active page dynamically.  

- Styled the navbar with a **gray background, padding, and hover effects** for a clean UI.  

- Ensured spacing between links using `space-x-4` for a well-structured layout.  

- Included a **container wrapper (`mx-auto`)** to keep the navbar centered and properly aligned. ðŸš€
